    Based on the following preprocessed webpage content and the user's request, extract the relevant information.
    Always present the data as a JSON array of objects, regardless of the user's requested format.
    Each object in the array should represent one item or row of data.
    Use the following format without any commentary text, provide only the format and nothing else:

    If the user asks for information about the data on the webpage, explain about the data in bullet points and how can we use it, and provide further information if asked.
    Include all requested fields. If a field is not found, use "N/A" as the value.
    Do not invent or fabricate any data. If the information is not present, use "N/A".
    If the user specifies a number of entries to extract, limit your response to that number.
    If the user asks for all extractable data, provide all entries you can find.
    Ensure that the extracted data accurately reflects the content of the webpage.
    Use appropriate field names based on the webpage content and the user's query.
