## üåê Multi-Page Scraping (BETA)

> **Note**: The multi-page scraping feature is currently in beta. While functional, you may encounter occasional issues or unexpected behavior. We appreciate your feedback and patience as we continue to improve this feature.

CyberScraper 2077 now supports multi-page scraping, allowing you to extract data from multiple pages of a website in one go. This feature is perfect for scraping paginated content, search results, or any site with data spread across multiple pages.

### How to Use Multi-Page Scraping

I suggest you enter the URL structure every time if you want to scrape multiple pages so it can detect the URL structure easily. It detects nearly all URL types.

1. **Basic Usage**:
   To scrape multiple pages, use the following format when entering the URL:
   ```
   https://example.com/page 1-5
   https://example.com/p/ 1-6
   https://example.com/xample/something-something-1279?p=1 1-3
   ```
   This will scrape pages 1 through 5 of the website.

2. **Custom Page Ranges**:
   You can specify custom page ranges:
   ```
   https://example.com/p/ 1-5,7,9-12
   https://example.com/xample/something-something-1279?p=1 1,7,8,9
   ```
   This will scrape pages 1 to 5, page 7, and pages 9 to 12.

3. **URL Patterns**:
   For websites with different URL structures, you can specify a pattern:
   ```
   https://example.com/search?q=cyberpunk&page={page} 1-5
   ```
   Replace `{page}` with where the page number should be in the URL.

4. **Automatic Pattern Detection**:
   If you don't specify a pattern, CyberScraper 2077 will attempt to detect the URL pattern automatically. However, for best results, specifying the pattern is recommended.

### Tips for Effective Multi-Page Scraping

- Start with a small range of pages to test before scraping a large number.
- Be mindful of the website's load and your scraping speed to avoid overloading servers.
- Use the `simulate_human` option for more natural scraping behavior on sites with anti-bot measures.
- Regularly check the website's `robots.txt` file and terms of service to ensure compliance.

### Example

```bash
URL Example : "https://news.ycombinator.com/?p=1 1-3 or 1,2,3,4"
```

If you want to scrape a specific page, just enter the query "please scrape page number 1 or 2". If you want to scrape all pages, simply give a query like "scrape all pages in csv" or whatever format you want.

### Handling Errors

If you encounter errors during multi-page scraping:
- Check your internet connection
- Verify the URL pattern is correct
- Ensure the website allows scraping
- Try reducing the number of pages or increasing the delay between requests

### Beta Feedback

As this feature is in beta, we highly value your feedback. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please:
1. Open an issue on our GitHub repository
2. Provide detailed information about the problem, including the URL structure and number of pages you were attempting to scrape
3. Share any error messages or unexpected behaviors you observed

Your input is crucial in helping us refine and stabilize this feature for future releases.

## üßÖ Tor Network Scraping

> **Note**: The Tor network scraping feature allows you to access and scrape .onion sites. This feature requires additional setup and should be used responsibly and legally.

CyberScraper 2077 now supports scraping .onion sites through the Tor network, allowing you to access and extract data from the dark web safely and anonymously. This feature is perfect for researchers, security analysts, and investigators who need to gather information from Tor hidden services.

### Prerequisites

1. Install Tor on your system:
   ```bash
   # Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt install tor
   
   # macOS (using Homebrew)
   brew install tor
   
   # Start the Tor service
   sudo service tor start  # on Linux
   brew services start tor # on macOS
   ```

2. Install additional Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install PySocks requests[socks]
   ```

### Using Tor Scraping

1. **Basic Usage**:
   Simply enter an .onion URL, and CyberScraper will automatically detect and route it through the Tor network:
   ```
   http://example123abc.onion
   ```

2. **Safety Features**:
   - Automatic .onion URL detection
   - Built-in connection verification
   - Tor Browser-like request headers
   - Automatic circuit isolation

### Configuration Options

You can customize the Tor scraping behavior by adjusting the following settings:
```python
tor_config = TorConfig(
    socks_port=9050,          # Default Tor SOCKS port
    circuit_timeout=10,        # Timeout for circuit creation
    auto_renew_circuit=True,   # Automatically renew Tor circuit
    verify_connection=True     # Verify Tor connection before scraping
)
```

### Security Considerations

- Always ensure you're complying with local laws and regulations
- Use a VPN in addition to Tor for extra security
- Be patient as Tor connections can be slower than regular web scraping
- Avoid sending personal or identifying information through Tor
- Some .onion sites may be offline or unreachable

### Docker Support

For Docker users, add these additional flags to enable Tor support:
```bash
docker run -p 8501:8501 \
  --network="host" \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key" \
  cyberscraper-2077
```

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with Tor scraping:
- Verify Tor service is running (`sudo service tor status`)
- Check SOCKS port availability (`netstat -an | grep 9050`)
- Ensure proper Tor installation (`tor --version`)
- Verify internet connectivity
- Check firewall settings

## Setup Google Sheets Authentication:

1. Go to the Google Cloud Console (https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Select your project.
3. Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials".
4. Find your existing OAuth 2.0 Client ID and delete it.
5. Click "Create Credentials" > "OAuth client ID".
6. Choose "Web application" as the application type.
7. Name your client (e.g., "CyberScraper 2077 Web Client").
8. Under "Authorized JavaScript origins", add:
   - http://localhost:8501
   - http://localhost:8502
   - http://127.0.0.1:8501
   - http://127.0.0.1:8502
9. Under "Authorized redirect URIs", add:
   - http://localhost:8501/
   - http://127.0.0.1:8501/
   - http://localhost:8502/
   - http://127.0.0.1:8502/
10. Click "Create" to generate the new client ID.
11. Download the new client configuration JSON file and rename it to `client_secret.json`.

## Adjusting PlaywrightScraper Settings (optional)

Customize the `PlaywrightScraper` settings to fit your scraping needs. If some websites are giving you issues, you might want to check the behavior of the website:

```bash
use_stealth: bool = True,
simulate_human: bool = False,
use_custom_headers: bool = True,
hide_webdriver: bool = True,
bypass_cloudflare: bool = True:
```

Adjust these settings based on your target website and environment for optimal results.

You can also bypass the captcha using the ```-captcha``` parameter at the end of the URL. The browser window will pop up, complete the captcha, and go back to your terminal window. Press enter and the bot will complete its task.
